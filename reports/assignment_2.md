## 1. What are 2 things that you learned from this assignment?
<b>Ans:</b> The two most important things that I learned from this assignment are as folows:-
<br>
<br>**- Structure of Xinu**:- Through this assignment I learned the thread-like structure of Xinu. 
    		Xinu provides an abstraction of processes although it utilizes the features of a thread.
			  Hence,Xinu provides the flexibility of sharing the address space.
      	While utilizing this feature, I was able to perform data sharing between the threads.
      	Working with data sharing made me face complexisities on how handle the threads.
        This led me towards the concept of synchronization and the ways in which this can be achieved.
			
**-Write shell commands in Xinu** :- Through this assignment, I gathered a hands-on experience on to how to create shell commands in Xinu and use them for various operations.I gathered a clear insight on the flow of the "create" system calls.
			
## 2. What are the 2 mistakes that you made in this assignment, and how did you discover and fix these mistakes?
<b>Ans:</b> There were several mistakes that occured during the assignment.Two of the were as follows:-
<br>
<br><b>1. Handling exceptions</b> :- Handling exceptions are a very important criteria while we are handling procedural data.I realised my mistake while I was running my data through various cases.
<br>
<br><b>2. Handling iterative functions</b> :- Handling recursive functions is very important as in this assignment, iteration is a key factor in polling. Debugging the code helped me realize my errors and solve them.
	
## 3.If you were restarting this assignment, what would you change about how you went about completing this assignment?
<b>Ans:</b> If I was given the opportnity to restart the assignment, I would prefer gaining some insights on semaphore and its features so that i would have been able to optimize my code.
