Q1)What is Orphan and Zombie processes?
Ans)
ORPHAN PROCESS
->An orphan process is a process that runs in the system without any parent process.
->When a process becomes an orphan process , it is automatically adopted by the init process
ZOMBIE PROCESS
->A zombie process is a process which has exited from the system but is still present inside the process table.
->A zombie process is created ,when the parent process fails to collect the exit status of it's child process.As a result,the process table is not notified about the exit of the child process.
->Zombie process occupies unnecessary memory in the process table which results in memory leakage.

Q2)What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system call to execute a new program?
Ans)->When the child process calls the exec system call,a new process image replaces the current process image and transfer the control to it. It replaces the curent shell file descriptors.As a result,the instructions following exec will not be executed.
